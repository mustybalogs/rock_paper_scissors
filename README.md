# rock_paper_scissors
This a simple game.
It is between the computer and the user.
The user has 3 options, either to input, rock, paper or scissors.

How do you win?
If you input rock and the computer's input is scissors, you win.
If you input paper and the computer inputs rock, you win.
If you input scissors and the computer inputs says paper, you win.

The opposite of this means you have lost; for example, you input paper and computer inputs scissors, this means you have lost.

There is also a possiblity for a tie, whereby if the user nd the computer's input is the same, then its a tie. 
In such situations, you will be asked if you want to play again, just type in "yes".
